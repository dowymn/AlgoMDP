Little class I made to show my parents why it's important to have long and complex passwords.

Of course it doesn't represent the reality, but my goal was to make them understand that today, computers are way powerful enouth to try a lot of possibilities in a very short time.

If you want to try this, begin with a short password (5 characters or less) and then you can increase the size if you want.
Above 7 characters, the program will need a long time to find it.
